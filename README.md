I am a NERC funded PhD student at the University of Leeds, where I study lake-terminating glaciers in Greenland. 

Before this, I completed a BSc in Geography and an MRes in Antarctic glaciology at Durham University. My research uses satellite remote sensing to assess changes in glacier behaviour, as well as structure from motion techniques to observe iceberg calving at high resolutions.
