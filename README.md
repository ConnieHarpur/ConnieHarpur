I am a NERC funded PhD student at the University of Leeds, where I study lake-terminating glaciers in Greenland. 

Before this, I completed a BSc in Geography and an MRes in Antarctic Glaciology at Durham University. My research uses satellite remote sensing to assess recent changes to glaciers and ice shelves, as well as structure from motion techniques to observe iceberg calving at high resolutions.
